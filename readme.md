# Another Starter Theme
Yes, another WordPress starter theme, based on another starter theme, oh yeah!!!

## Why?
I've built countless times the same thing when creating a theme. I don't want to do this anymore.

## What it offeres
Nothing special that much:

* Based on [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s)
* Based on [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* A simple theme options panel, based on my [Settings API class](https://github.com/tareq1988/wordpress-settings-api-class)
* Two column (content - *span8*, sidebar - *span4*)
* One navigation menu. Yes, it's styled, you don't have to write css for this fracking menubar again.
* Pagination
* LESS CSS
* Font Awesome
* Responsive
